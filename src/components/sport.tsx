          Outside of coding, I spend a lot of time strengthening the same skills
          that matter in software development — focus, logic, and problem-solving.
          One of my favorite activities is playing chess ♟️, which helps me think
          multiple steps ahead and stay calm while solving complex challenges.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also enjoy reading books 📚, especially those related to technology,
          self-improvement, and logical thinking. Reading helps me build deeper
          understanding, improve clarity of thought, and stay motivated to grow
          both personally and professionally.
        </p>

        <p>
          Learning new technologies 💻 is something I genuinely enjoy, not just a
          requirement. I regularly explore modern tools, frameworks, and concepts
          related to full-stack development, backend systems, and AI-driven
          applications to stay up to date with the fast-moving tech ecosystem.
        </p>

        <p>
          Whether it’s solving a chess problem, understanding a new framework, or
          reading about system design, I like activities that challenge my mind
          and push me to think more efficiently and creatively.
        </p>

        <p>
          These habits help me stay consistent, curious, and disciplined — the
          same qualities I bring into my projects, internships, and collaborative
          development work.
